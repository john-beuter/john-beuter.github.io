## Project Overview

For my senior design course at Iowa State, I was given the oppurtunity to work with five other engineers to develop a satellite payload capable of perform three continual tasks related to in-space serciving, assembly, and/or manufactoring (ISAM). Through this porject I had the oppurtunity to collaborate with NASA and industry advisors to help create designs to meet the challenge requirements. 


### My Contributions

#### Leadership
I had the oppurtunity to work as team lead for this project. Being able to contribute and challenge myself as a leader. Working on such a complex problem as designing a satellite in space with litle experience was challenging. Through working to develop a strong team culture, I sought to use my leadership skills to empower the team towards it's goals. 

### Technical

For my work on the project I had the oppurtunity to research net deployment in lower earth orbit. As the project continues to develop I expect to apply my knowledge in the development of CAD designs and prototpyes.

#### Resources

In the project, my group has had the pleasure of working with NASA employees and private sector advisors. These adivisors have provided my group access to invaluable resources to help us develop our designs. 

### Takeaways

* In-depth understanding of Operational Technology <br>
* Enhanced technical writing skills <br>
* Broadened idea of the application of security concepts beyond Information Technology
