## Project Overview

As a part of my summer internship at the Advanced Course in Engineering, I had the oppurtunity to conduct research for the Ministry of Defence (MOD) in the U.K. The main focus of my research of was Operational Technology (OT) security. The goal of my research team of six engineers was to provide an educative Operational Technology exercise for newcomers to OT attending Defence Cyber Marvel (DCM). Given the nature of the excercise, I cannot provide full documentation. 

### Our project requirements from MOD Were As Follows: 

1. Solution must be created from commercial off the shelf products and open-source software
2. The training excercise should take up 60-90 minutes
3. Provide full documentation for Defense Cyber Marvel organizers to rebuild and re-create the project 

### My Contributions

For my role on the team I was tasked with researching and developing exploits for our training environment. I created Modbus exploits written in Python, Go, and Nim that were designed to deny legitimate traffic from our human machine interface to our simulated programmable logic controllers. Beyond the technical implementation of these exploits, I created written reports outlining how these attacks worked, and how OT professionals could counter these threats. Beyone communicating the work that I did, I also collected information about real world attacks and condensed the information to a beginner knowledge level.

### Resources Used

### Takeaways

* In-depth understanding of Operational Technology <br>
* Enhanced technical writing skills <br>
* Broadened idea of the application of security concepts beyond Information Technology
