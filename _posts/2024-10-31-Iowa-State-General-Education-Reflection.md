## Learning and Applying my Spanish Learning

From the general education course that I have taken at Iowa State University, I have developed a broad understanding of multiple cultures. While at Iowa State, I took courses in Spanish and earned a minor. Through pursuing this minor, I had the opportunity to take class, including SPAN 3030B: Conversations for Professional, SPAN 3510: Introduction to Span-English Translations, and SPAN 3210: Spanish Civilization. In each of these courses, I had the opportunity to work with individuals from different cultural, ethnic, and educational backgrounds and develop common ground through the use of the Spanish language. 

My education in Spanish culminated when I had the opportunity to study abroad in Spain. Leading up to my study abroad experience, I took the SPAN 3230: Spain Today, which I believe was the most influential class I could take while pursuing my minor. Through the course there were numerous opportunities to dive into how past events formed and influenced the Spain of today. 3230 solidified what all of the other Spanish courses taught me about engineering: Cultural shared understanding creates meaningful relationships. 

Engineering is a multinational and collaborative career field that is only getting more interconnected. As engineers, we must have the interpersonal tact to collaborate across cultural divides effectively. Effective collaboration comes from trust and a sense of shared understanding. You forge meaningful interpersonal connections by working to develop shared understanding and trust. I reflect on my experience living in Spain and how I used my knowledge of political events in Spanish history to start meaningful and appropriate conversations that developed interpersonal shared understanding. 

As engineers, we constantly challenge ourselves to learn how things work and why they are the way they are. Equally important as understanding how things work is understanding how people work. To create successful engineering teams, multinational or not, we must ask how and why people are the way. We must discover what motivates our team members and what cultural factors dictate how they can collaborate. Through a developed shared understanding of culture, history, and world events, we as engineers can break down potential barriers and have more meaningful collaboration.
