## Learning to Lead


This summer, I had the honor of participating in the 2024 ACE class, where I earned the title of distinguished graduate and class Valedictorian. For those unfamiliar with the program, ACE is a cyber security initiative designed to enhance participants' cyber skills through a combination of leadership and academic lectures, military cyber operations, and cutting-edge research.

One of the program's highlights was the various lecture concepts we covered. From each lecture, we were given challenge problems that tested our understanding of cyber security fields, including malware analysis, red teaming, and cryptography, to name a few. These challenges enhanced my abilities to solve problems and communicate the solutions in reports that were 20-30 pages long.

In my research project at ACE, I focused on operational technology, where I had the opportunity to develop and create exploits for programmable logic controllers. These exploits will be used in an upcoming training exercise called Defense Cyber Marvel, organized by the Defense Cyber Academy in the United Kingdom. This experience expanded my technical knowledge and honed my leadership and public speaking skills, as I had the opportunity to command multiple cyber operations teams composed of military officers, university students, and civilians from various nations.
