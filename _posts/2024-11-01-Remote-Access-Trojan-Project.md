## Project Overview

As a part of the digital forensic class offered at Iowa State, students are given the chance to create their own projects related to digital forensic investigations. For my project I developed and implemented a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) which I wrote in C. I designed an entire scenario around the deployment of the RAT and created an investigation that mirrored how an digital forensic analyst would potentially uncover the malware. My project was heavily inspired by Madiant's report - "APT1
Exposing One of Chinaâ€™s Cyber Espionage Units" and I even had the oppurtunity to share my project with some Mandiant employees and receive feedback for how to improve my project. For more information technical information on the project, please refer to my github!

### Resources Used

For my project I used numerous online tutorial basic malware design concepts like process injection. My project also gave me the oppurtunity to learn how to work with the Windows API which gather skills for using the available online documentation. 

### Takeaways

* Understanding of malware developement techniques for Windows devices <br>
* Forensic investigation pratice through finding evidence of the malwares presence <br>
* Enhance programming skills in C
