### Prompt
Write a one paragraph reflection briefly stating the most important leadership lesson you will take away from ACE and why it is important to you in the future positions you see yourself taking. Please cite no more than three specific experiences most impactful to your leadership development over the last 10 weeks (leadership case study lessons, speakers, staff feedback, GA comments, or ACE teams). 


### Response
The most important lesson about leadership that I have taken away from ACE is the phrase “Leadership is easy if you don’t think about yourself,” which contributes to the idea of servant leadership. One of the most formative moments I had that developed my understanding of this quote on leadership was when I received my midterm feedback. The feedback I received was to be a more decisive leader and not be afraid to rock the boat in my teams. For the longest time I believed I was approaching leadership as a servant leader by never causing confrontation or awkwardness. By never pushing back within my team culture, even when I knew things were wrong, I thought I was showing compassion to my teammates. As I reflected on it, I realized that I was thinking about myself and not the team. I was thinking about my relationships with the people on my team and not wanting to jeopardize the trust we shared. I realized that what I thought was compassion was actually hurting the team. I understood trust must be developed first but I did not understand that trust allows leaders to rock the boat without sinking the ship. Leadership is the power of relying on developed trust to be able to tell people what they don’t want to hear and motivate them to act. I had to be able to tell people what they didn’t want to hear and live with the consequences if I wanted to lead. Developing this skill is something that is easier said than done and takes practice but through this program I was able to do that and learn invaluable lessons from the feedback I received along the way. When in command, command.


Developing my approach to leadership to align with this sentiment has given me the ability to be a better leader and become more dynamic in my approach to situations. Instead of focusing internally with my style of leadership where I prioritized things like, if I will look dumb or smart by suggesting this course of action. By instead prioritizing the needs of the team and thinking instead, how can I make my team better, how can I make everyone around me better, and how can I genuinely lead with others instead of worrying about being a leader myself. I observed in myself the ability to become a better leader and to form a better team. Through the prioritization of empowering others and thinking about how I can build them into leaders I feel like I grew the most. I looked back at alot of our case studies and thought about when were times that leaders were successful and when were times leaders failed. The common occurrence that I found between all of the failures was that the leader in the situation never came across as someone who wanted to empower their teams to be successful. NASA, having strong leaders that wanted to cover their backs without empowering those below them to step up and prioritize the mission.
