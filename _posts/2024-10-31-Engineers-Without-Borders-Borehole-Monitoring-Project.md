## Overview of My Time in Engineers Without Borders

One of the major reasons behind why I wanted to become an engineer was I wanted the oppurtunity to help people. I wanted to know that whatever I had the oppurtunity to work on had the potential to make the difference in the lives of others. In my Sophomore year I discovered my universities chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB). 

EWB combines numerous disciplines of engineerinng and present unique challenges, oppurtunities, and potential for growth. Iowa State's chapter of EWB, numbering ~60 members accross 5 different engineering teams, is partnered with the Ullo community in western Ghana facilitating the development of a large scale medical clinc and numerous other smaller projects. When I first joined the organization I was on a team of 15 engineers performing power calculations for the clinic. As the clinic electrical designs were finalized myself and other team members recognized the need to use our skill sets in electrical, computer, and software engineering to help with other projects within EWB ISU. 

From this idea of using our unique skills we created a new sub group within EWB ISU that focused on the research and development of new ideas to help other teams in EWB. The first project I had the oppurtunity to manage was the research of data transmission from remote water pumps using MQTT. As the research for the project grew, the idea expanded into addressing how we could provide the EWB water distribution team with reliable real time data from water tanks in Ghana. In the past, teams would have to travel to Ghana during one of the groups many trips, measure the water tanks over the period of the trip and use that data for the remainder of the year to make their calculations and assumptions about water consumption in the community. The team that I had the oppurutunity to eventually lead was given the task of creating a small scale device that could monitor the water within the tanks over time and transmitt that data over the internet back to engineers at Iowa State. 

### My Contributions

#### Leadership

Through my time in EWB, I had the oppurtunity to lead multiple teams as we solved numerous technical problems. As a leader I strived to empower junior memebers to find, create, and develop their own projects. Through working with numerous engineers I had the oppurtunity to help other step into leadership positions and help develop their abilities to lead. 

As a technical team lead I worked to the most technically competent member of the group. I conducted research, accuired parts, and collaborated accross other teams within EWB to help give my team relevant information, resources, and help with the project needs. Stepping into these positions of leadership and challenging myself to remain hands on with the engineering work has given me the skills necessary to lead in a technical team environment. 

### Technical

With the development and research done on the Borehole Monitoring Device, I had the chance to apply my engineering skills in the development of wireless data transmission for the device. I learned how to implement MQTT protocol and transmit data with that protocol then publish information to a website. Working with MQTT allowed me to understand networking in a more in depth manner and challenged me to think about the security implications of my design choices. Through this project and documentation of my work I challenged myself as an engineer to not only design a solution that functioned but was also secure by design.

#### Resources Used


### Lasting Impact

The Borehole Monitoring Device has been one of the most exiciting engineering projects that I have had the oppurtunity to work on. The team that created the device and helped implement it into the community have been second to none. As EWB continues to develop and revise this design after I have left Iowa State I hope that through my time and contributions that I was able to lead and inspire the next generation of EWB engineers to challenge themselves to solve the complex problems that we often face.
