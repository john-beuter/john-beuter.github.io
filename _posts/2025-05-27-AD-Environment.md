## Project Overview and Intro

 Ending my Senior year at Iowa State I wanted to challenge myself to learn more Active Directory (AD), something seldom discussed in my course work. I created a Windows 2016 server virtual machine (vm) to function as my AD server and joined two Windows 11 vms to the domain. This post is the first in a series I am writing over my learning experiences with AD. In the future I hope to publish dedicated articles related to the Blue, Red, and Purple team goals I have set for this projcet. My goals for the AD environment can be defined below.

### Goals: 

1. Create an Active Directory server and join a Windows client to the server [Blue team]
  - Include numerous user accounts with varying levels of privledges (both local and domain accounts)
2. Implement various attack on AD 
  - Eternal blue with mimikatz for lateral movement
  - Golden Ticket
  - AS-REP Roasting
3. Understand potential indicators of compromise in an AD environment as it is being exploited[Purple team]


### Progress as of September 2025
