## My Time at Iowa State

If I could summarize my experience at Iowa State and primarily the lessons I learned academically, I would use the following quote, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”. Through numerous courses, clubs, and extracurricular activities, Iowa State has allowed me to collaborate with great engineers who have pushed me to be the best I can be. With my reflection, I would like to highlight how my computer engineering courses, experience in Engineers Without Borders, and participation in the on-campus Cyber Defense Competitions have made me into the engineer I am today. 

As a part of the cyber security engineering program, students take a computer architecture course. In the course, students work in small groups to write code that simulates a computer's processor. I was overwhelmed by the assignment and unsure I could make it. Instead of getting down on myself or giving I turned to my teammate. Through hard work, asking questions relentlessly, and working with others, I excelled in the course and all areas of my academic life. That computer architect course taught me the power of working with others and growing together through collaboration. Learning these lessons directly in coursework translated to other areas of my engineering background, primarily my involvement in Engineers Without Borders. 

I have been involved with the organization Engineers Without Borders throughout my time at Iowa State. Being a part of the organization gave me an outlet to do what I wanted to do most with my engineering skills: help people. A unique characteristic of Engineers Without Borders is that the organization's projects are primarily civil engineering-based. When I joined the club as a sophomore, I picked the only team that potentially needed and cybersecurity engineer, and that was the electrical engineering team. As time progressed and I collaborated across the club with teams in different groups and learned about civil engineering projects, I found a way to combine my skills with the other team's civil engineering needs. I created a team whose specific purpose was to develop electronic devices to monitor and transmit data from water pump tanks. Through being challenged to think outside the box continually in my course work, I could translate my drive for engineering into different fields outside of what I was taught in the classroom and apply those skills to help people in need. 

Thinking beyond the classroom is a skill that I was able to fully hone by participating in extracurricular activities provided by Iowa State. The primary example of learning these unique skills was the Cyber Defense Competitions (CDCs). During the CDCs at Iowa State, I was allowed to collaborate with other cybersecurity engineering students and apply the concepts we had learned in introductory cybersecurity courses. Through the hands-on application of the course concepts, I saw the direct correlation between the classroom and a potential career in cyber security. Beyond the direct application of course material, I was able to expand my knowledge and learn new things that I could not have learned in the classroom. Through my experiences in the CDC, I was able to see how real attackers would exploit a network and actively be able to combat those attackers. Through these competitions, I gained invaluable experience that I could directly apply to a future career in cybersecurity.
